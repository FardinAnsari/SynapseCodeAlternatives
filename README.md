# SynapseCodeAlternatives
SQL query alternates for synapse I couldn't find on the Internet so I am writing them down here.

In this repository, I am providing alternate to pieces of code that worked in SQL but not Azure Data warehouse as of 2nd Feb 2024. these features might come in the future, but they are a big problem if you are migrating your system from SQL to Synapse and don't want to change your whole infrastructure. hence creating this as a guide for those pieces of code.
